# 🧠 My Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Data Science learning repository! 🎯  
This repository is a living collection of everything I practice as I grow my skills in data science — from basic Python and statistics to advanced machine learning techniques.

## 🔍 Current Focus: Feature Engineering 🔧

I'm currently diving deep into **Feature Engineering**, which is one of the most critical parts of building effective machine learning models.  
My practice includes:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Target Encoding)
- Feature scaling (Standardization, Normalization)
- Binning & Bucketing
- Date/Time feature extraction
- Text-based feature creation
- Feature transformation (log, sqrt, power transforms)
- Feature selection techniques (filter, wrapper, embedded methods)
- Creating interaction and polynomial features
